# Lead_Scoring
**Problem Statement**

**Business Goal**

Create a logistic regression model to give each lead a score ranging from 0 to 100, which the business may use to target prospective leads. In contrast to a lower score, which indicates that the lead is chilly and unlikely to convert, a higher number indicates that the lead is hot, or most likely to convert.
We will also need to deal with some additional issues that the company has identified, which our model should be able to adapt to if the needs of the organisation change in the future.
